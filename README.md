## About the project
![New Readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27232476/230889123-23989707-989d-4142-b04d-137c65ae12b8.jpg)
### This project is the implementation of a Pokedex with React using NextJS Tailwind. Tailwind was used to speed up the Layout construction and content management process a bit.
### The tool used to do the unit tests was Cypress.
### The project also uses SASS to style some components, initially the idea was to use Styled Components, but Tailwind does not have much compatibility with it.
### The project uses the PokeApi to render the Pokémons information. As the PokeApi does not provide images for the Pokémons, the images are taken from the website https://www.pokemon.com/br/pokedex/.
